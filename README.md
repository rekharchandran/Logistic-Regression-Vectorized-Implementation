### Logistic-Regression Vectorized implementation using iris data

In machine learning, thereâ€™s a concept of an optimization algorithm that tries to reduce the error and computes to get the best parameters for the machine learning model. So by using a vectorized implementation in an optimization algorithm we can make the process of computation much faster compared to Unvectorized Implementation.

A basic example of Optimization Algorithm: Gradient Descent
